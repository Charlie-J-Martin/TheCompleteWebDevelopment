OAuth - Open Authorization
Allows third party services to exchange your information without you having to give your password away. 

Why OAuth?
1. Granular Access Levels
	- You can request specific information. E.g. Email and Name.
2. Read / Read/Write access
	- Third party apps can write to facebook.
3. Revoke Access 
	- Users can choose not to give access to the third party website. E.g. If a user didn't want their information to be shared on the third party anymore they could use their facebook account to restrict access.

Setting up OAuth
1. Has to be set up in their developer console and we recieve an app ID.
2. User logs into facebook option and then is transfer to facebook.
3. Once they log in they need to review the permission that is being requested.
4. Authorization code is then sent from Facebook to our site confirming that they have signed in.
5. We can then create an access token which can be used to get lots of other useful information that could have been granted in step 3.
